        "policy": "Returning Items that Contain Hazardous Materials\n\n All products that contain substances that are flammable, pressurised, corrosive,\n         damaging to the environment, irritant, or harmful, are classified as Hazmat items or dangerous goods in the EU.\nIf transported commercially, Hazmat items may pose a higher risk than other items.\n         Although quantities sold by Amazon.co.uk are limited and, therefore, carry a relatively low risk during transport, our carriers\n         and our Fulfillment Centers must follow specific guidelines during transportation\n         and handling. If you want to return such items, you must follow the guidelines set\n         out below.\nOnly use our Returns Center to return these items. If you\u2019re returning a Hazmat item from outside the UK, you may be asked to contact us for assistance with your return. \n\nPackaging\n If possible, use the original Amazon packaging when sending the product back to us.\n            This packaging has the labeling and packaging formats that you must apply. If your\n            Amazon packaging is damaged, use new packaging. For items that contain batteries,\n            including lithium batteries, make sure that the package is strong and rigid. Secure\n            the equipment against movement within the outer packaging and against accidental activation.\n            Close containers with liquids, aerosols, or other substances prone to spillage tightly\n            so they don't leak. Place the containers upright in the box and make sure they're\n            not loose. Put filling materials, such as the filling material provided by Amazon\n            or some newspaper, around the product to fill any empty spaces in the box.\n If you're returning multiple Hazmat items, you must only return one item per parcel\n            to ensure compliance.\nGo to Your Orders to return your items and print a return label for each item.\n\n\nLabeling\nIf you're returning the item in its original packaging, you don't need to apply a\n            new label. \nPlease check if the label is legible, it should look like one of these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, print out the label or any other label provided in our Returns Center, and apply it to your parcel.\n\n\nCarrier\n In our Returns Center, you'll receive either a prepaid return label to use with a particular carrier, or\n            a return label that you can use with a carrier of your choice, depending on your location.\n            Don't use a return method for these items other than that advised by our Returns Center. Amazon.co.uk may arrange for a specialist carrier to collect these items.\n\n\nDamaged Hazmat\n If you receive a damaged Hazmat item, don't use it, and follow the instructions on\n            the product.\n Damaged Hazmat items, including damaged lithium batteries, aren't returnable and should\n               be disposed of in a recycling center. If the item you want to return contains damaged lithium batteries, detach them from\n            the item before returning. You can then return the item without the battery. If you\n            can't detach the damaged battery, or if the item itself is a damaged lithium battery,\n            please dispose of it in the nearest recycling center. Contact Customer Services for information on the recycling center and further steps. Amazon.co.uk reserves the right to request proof of such disposal at any time, so make sure that\n            you obtain appropriate evidence from the recycling center you use."
